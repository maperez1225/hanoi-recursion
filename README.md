# hanoi-recursion
Solution to the Hanoi Towers puzzle using recursion for algorithms class homework.
Reads the text file "data/Hanoi_input.txt" as instructions:
The first line of the file contains the m amount of times the program will run, and for the subsequent m lines, these will contain the n amount of disks to solve the hanoi puzzle with.
Every move will be written in the text file "data/Hanoi_output.txt"
This program will not verify any issues related to reading and writing files, therefore the input must be verified before running.
